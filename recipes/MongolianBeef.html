        <li>1-2 Cups Brocolli or brocollini, stalks removed, sliced</li>
        <li>1 Thumb Ginger, minced</li>
        <li>1-2 Tablespoons Cornstarch</li>

        <br>For the sauce:

        <li>2 Tablespoons Brown Sugar</li>
        <li>1 Tablespoon Cornstarch</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Take the thinly sliced beef and mix with cornstarch for at least 15 minutes before frying.</li>
        <li>While you are waiting make the sauce in a small bowl by mixing the soy sauce, brown sugar, 
            and cornstarch together in a small bowl.</li>
        <li>Heat up a pan or wok with the fat over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Cook the beef in batches until brown, do not crowd the beef or the meat will steam instead of
            browning properly. Add more fat as needed.</li>
        <li>Remove the beef once all pieces are sufficiently browned, add more oil and add in </li>
        <li>Turn the heat up to high. Once the fat starts to smoke dd the brocolli slice and the 
            chopped red onion, cook until soft (should only take a minute or 2). Stir occasionally.
            The red peppers can also be added here if you like it spicy.</li>
        <li>Turn the heat back down to medium and add the garlic and ginger, cook until fragrant (30 seconds
            or so).</li>

        <li>Remove from the heat and serve, add sesame seeds and green onion. Best served over rice!</li>
