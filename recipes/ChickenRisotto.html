    <h3>Optional:</h3>
    <li>Parsley (for garnish)</li>
    <li>Chicken Drumsticks can also be used</li>
    <li>Chicken Bouillon Cube</li>

    <h3>Required:</h3>
    <li>9 Pieces Chicken Thighs</li>
    <li>1 Large Red Onion, chopped</li>
    <li>3-6 Cloves Garlic, minced</li>
    <li>Salt</li>
    <li>Pepper</li>
    <li>Paprika</li>
    <li>Cooking Fat (e.g. Olive Oil, Ghee, Schmaltz)</li>
    <li>Chicken Stock or Broth (Homemade is best)</li>
    <li>1.5 cups Brown Rice</li>
</ul>

<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 400F. Heat a dutch oven or heavy pot over medium-high heat.</li>
    <li>Season your chicken with salt, pepper, and paprika on both sides.</li>
    <li>Brown the chicken with the pot in batches, start skin side down. Do not crowd the pot as this
        will cause the chicken to boil instead of searing.</li>
    <li>Remove the chicken from the pot and set aside, add the onions to the pot and stir occasionally.</li>
    <li>Once the onions are softened (approximately 2 minutes), add the minced garlic and cook until
        fragrant (about 30 seconds).</li>
    <li>Add the brown rice to the pot and stir over the heat for about 30 seconds.</li>
    <li>Add 1 cup of chicken stock and stir to remove any brown bits from searing the chicken.</li>
    <li>Add the chicken back into the pot and add the stock until the chicken is covered.
        Optionally add a buillon cube for extra chicken flavor.</li>
    <li>Add the lid to the pot (slightly ajar) and put in the oven for 40 minutes.</li>
    <li>After 40 mintues remove the pot from the oven, if the rice is not finished, simmer over medium-low
        heat until cooked.</li>
    <li>Serve the delicious chicken and risotto together with chopped garnish on top such as flat leafed parsley!</li>
