# odin-recipes

This repo is used as an introduction for my basic HTML skills, it will include a list of Kyle's delicious recipes!

I'm going to use recipes sort of based on memory that I like to make all the time. I'll include some pictures of the results that I've made before to tantalize the olfactorys and add a bit of flavor (no pun intended) to the project!

Recipes will include:

Baked 1-Pot Chicken + Brown Rice (risoto???)
Beef Bourguignon
Chicken Stir Fry
Mongolian Beef
